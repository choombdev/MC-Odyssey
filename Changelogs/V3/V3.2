Changes:
= Improved Pack start time tremendously (By replacing Chisel, sadly), the pack now fully loads in 11 minutes instead of minutes!
= Removed all issues within scripts. 
= Stopped some mods from sending un-necessary errors and updates. 
Removals:
// Dev note: I've removed mods that could cause or have caused performance issues since their addition, mods that are already replaced by more popular mods within the pack and mods that are simply useless, this should increase the general performance alongside the fixes I've deployed //
